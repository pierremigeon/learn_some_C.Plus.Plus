I've decided to try my hand at learning some C++, because I think it would be useful to have at least a smidgen (or more!) of knowledge on the subject. I think that since I know how to program in C, I might as well explore its more modern relative. I'm following the 42 c++ piscine curriculum. Turns out that I enjoy the topic, and so this has been my primary project over the past few weeks.
